# Mine-Sweeper

Minesweeper game written in C

the Logics of the game is not  writen by me completely and there are Snippets of others code present in this program. the File handling is not completely implemented and needs some better hands to work on them.
for the program to correctly print and run you need to enable Unicodes on your system and run your console in fullscreen.
